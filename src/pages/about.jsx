          <p className='pb-4 md:pb-16'>
            Square Wave was founded four years ago by a group of designers and
            developers with a passion for creating beautiful and functional
            digital products.
          </p>
          <p className='pb-4'>
            Early on, we worked on a variety of projects for clients across
            different industries, from e-commerce websites to mobile apps.
          </p>
          <p className='pb-4'>
            One of our first major projects was a mobile app for a health and
            wellness startup, which became hugely popular and received
            widespread media coverage.
          </p>
          <p className='pb-4'>
            Another project we're particularly proud of is a website we designed
            for a local non-profit organization, which helped them raise
            awareness and attract more donations.
          </p>
          <p className='pb-4'>
            Over the years, we've continued to expand our portfolio and take on
            more ambitious projects.
          </p>
          <p className='pb-4'>
            We worked with a well-known fashion brand to design and develop an
            immersive online shopping experience that integrated seamlessly with
            their in-store operations.
          </p>
          <p className='pb-4'>
            We also designed and developed a custom CRM system for a real estate
            agency, streamlining their processes and increasing their
            efficiency.
          </p>
          <p className='pb-4'>
            One of our most recent projects was a mobile app for a startup in
            the travel industry, which featured a unique user interface and
            advanced search algorithms to help users find the perfect vacation
            destination.
          </p>
          <p className='pb-4'>
            Throughout our history, we've always prioritized user experience and
            design aesthetics, and our clients have consistently praised us for
            our attention to detail and commitment to quality.
          </p>
          <p className='pb-4'>
            As we look to the future, we're excited to continue pushing the
            boundaries of what's possible in design and technology, and to
            continue delivering outstanding products that help our clients
            succeed.
          </p>
          <p className='pb-4'>
            Our team is made up of talented designers, developers, and project
            managers who work together closely to ensure that every project is a
            success.
          </p>
          <p className='pb-4'>
            We believe that collaboration and transparency are key to achieving
            great results, and we're dedicated to building long-lasting
            relationships with our clients.
          </p>
          <p className='pb-4'>
            At Square Wave, we're more than just a design agency â€“ we're a team
            of passionate professionals who are driven by a shared vision of
            creating products that have a positive impact on the world.
          </p>
          <p className='pb-4'>
            We're excited to see what the future holds, and we can't wait to
            continue making waves in the design industry.
